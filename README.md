Hey guys! The guys. A Java guy?
===============================

These are the results from a short survey I ran on the use of "guys".

You can see
[the survey questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qg85hU7hfjqDgydlfa16UveuENFjgp23WlfkRNsnm48/viewform), and possibly still reply.

About 2300 people answered the survey in all. The results (minus email
addresses) are in a CSV in this repository.

Here's a summary of the survey results. I've split it up by gender: I
asked each person "Do you identify as a woman?", so I've split the
categories into "Women", and "Men + Other".

You can also see [the IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/guys-guys-guys/blob/master/The%20guys.ipynb) that I used to generate the graph, and [a blog post](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/27/guys-guys-guys/) 
where I write a bit about the motivations and my thoughts.

If you come up with other views on this data, I'd be interested in
hearing about it.
